The Nelsonâ€™s Library App is software that utilizes the operational logic of a physical library and mimics it digitally through an application.
Through this application, users with two different profiles can, on one hand, browse available or unavailable books before physically requesting them, and on the other hand, dynamically manage the resources available in the actual library, which are digitally represented in the application.
The software operates based on the Python programming language using GUI and relies on a MySQL Workbench database.
